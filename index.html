                            Ada Lovelace was born as a disappointment to her father, famed poet Lord Byron.
                            <br>
                            She was abandoned by her father, who expected a "glorious boy", but was instead
                            presented with a baby girl. Her mother, Anne Isabella Milbanke promoted her
                            interest in math and science from a young age in an attempt to prevent her from
                            developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her father.
                            <br>
                            Ada's status as Lord Byron's daughter opened the door to higher education, and her
                            ideas and intelligence gained her respect in a field dominated by men.
                            <br>
                            Her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Machine would eventually be recognized as
                            the first computer algorithm, making her the <b>first ever computer programmer.</b>

                            From the time she was a kid, she showed signs of genius. She would assemble and
                            reassemble clocks, determined to learn the way they work.
                            <br>
                            During World War II, Hopper voluntarily enlisted to the U.S. Navy and
                            had to request an exemption for being 15lbs under the weight limit.
                            She was sworn into the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1943 and was commissioned
                            as a lieutenant and assigned to the Bureau of Ordinance
                            Computation Project at Harvard University.
                            <br>
                            In her later career, she released some of the first compiler-based programming
                            languages,  MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.
                            Her belief that that programs should be written in a language that was
                            close to English led to COBOL, the first programming language designed for
                            business use, and the <b>predecessor to modern coding languages.</b>

                            As late as the 1960s many people perceived computer programming as a natural career
                            choice for savvy young women. Even the trend-spotters at Cosmopolitan Magazine urged
                            their fashionable female readership to consider careers in programming. In an article
                            titled “The Computer Girls,” the magazine described the field as offering better
                            job opportunities for women than many other professional careers.

                            Up until about the 1980s, computer science was booming in popularity for women.

                            So... what happened in the early-mid 80s that closed off this field for so many women?
                            <br>
                            Why has it remained unattractive for women to this day, while other fields are
                            consistently increasing in the number of women they attract?
                            <br>
                            These are questions of representation that we might never know the definitive answer to,
                            but a few key factors had a direct impact, to this day.

                            Revenge Of The Nerds was released and was a hit among the
                            booming nerd subculture of the '80s. It gave a voice to one
                            group, while effectively eclipsing another. The glorification of
                            the "nerd" never included the female nerd, while
                            simultaneously encompassing the representation of a computer scientist

                            Nerd culture exploded in popularity, and with it came a new,
                            mainstream idea of the computer nerd and the computer scientist.
