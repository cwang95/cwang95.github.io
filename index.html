                            Women in Patriarchal societies tend to become less competitive around puberty, 
                            while no change is seen in matriarchal societies. This same phenomena 
                            is seen in all girl’s schools versus co-educational schools, 
                            which indicates that male-dominant societies lead women to 
                            believe that they cannot compete as well as men can. Later in life, 
                            this is seen when women veer away from majors that are presumably difficult, 
                            like Computer Science.

                            By gendering college majors, we are suggesting that men are innately 
                            better in certain fields, while women are innately better at others. 
                            This perception is harmful and does not present all options to all 
                            people, but instead exacerbates societal norms.

                            Women are often pictured as less the less intelligent gender - less 
                            capable of succeeding in fields like Computer Science. If we do not 
                            work to actively destroy this mentality, it will never change. 
                            By pursuing Computer Science as a women, you are standing up 
                            against the idea that females do not belong in his field.

                                National Science Foundation is fighting to 
                                “un-brainwash” women into pursuing STEM careers. 
                                They use this terminology to suggest that the 
                                way society has indoctrinated the male ideal 
                                for STEM majors is comparable to brainwash!

                                As an incentive to get more women in engineering, they are offering more scholarships to females.
